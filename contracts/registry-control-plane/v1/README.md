# registry-control-plane v1

**Purpose:** Define the first native JSON HTTP control-plane package for operating a `spio` registry `v2` root over a backend service boundary.

**Last updated:** 2026-05-02

## Source Of Truth

- `registry-control-plane.contract.json` is the canonical status, descriptor, publish, and verify operation catalog.
- `registry-control-plane.examples.json` is the canonical request, success, and failure example pack.
- Human-readable registry docs stay secondary to this package.

## Repository Boundary

This package is shared by `styio-platform` and `styio-spio`.

- `styio-platform` operates the hosted registry and mirror service side.
- `styio-spio` consumes the package as the local package-manager compatibility contract.
- Offline package resolution, cache reuse, and local import/export behavior stay client-side and must not depend on platform mirror availability.

## Package Workflow

1. Edit `registry-control-plane.contract.json` and `registry-control-plane.examples.json`.
2. Update registry governance docs when route families or envelope rules change.
3. Verify the native JSON package with the contract and example gates before claiming compatibility.

## Stability Rules

- Additive optional request fields are allowed within `v1`.
- Renaming operations, changing required fields, or changing envelope semantics requires `v2`.
- Clients must treat undocumented fields as non-existent.
- Services must preserve the published method, path, and envelope spelling exactly.
- The descriptor operation is the public client trust handoff: it exposes the
  read-root URL, control-plane base URL, and pinned `trust/root.json` SHA-256
  that `styio-spio` imports before remote registry fetches.
- Generated third-party API-description artifacts are not valid source of truth for this contract.
