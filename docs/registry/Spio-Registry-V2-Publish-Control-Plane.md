# Spio Registry V2 Publish Control Plane

**Purpose:** Define the server-side responsibilities that produce the immutable `spio` registry `v2` static read plane without leaking dynamic publish behavior into the client-facing distribution protocol.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-21

## 1. Role

The publish control plane is the only trusted writer for a production `v2` registry.

It is responsible for:

- publisher authentication
- namespace authorization
- artifact upload admission
- digest verification
- package release admission
- signed metadata generation
- transparency-log append
- yank and deprecate state transitions

It is not part of the static read-plane protocol. Clients that install packages do not need this API surface.

The current versioned HTTP service contract for this plane lives in:

- [`../../contracts/registry-control-plane/v1/openapi.json`](../../contracts/registry-control-plane/v1/openapi.json)
- [`../../contracts/registry-control-plane/v1/workflows.arazzo.json`](../../contracts/registry-control-plane/v1/workflows.arazzo.json)
- [`./Spio-Registry-Control-Plane-Contract.md`](./Spio-Registry-Control-Plane-Contract.md)

## 2. Required Write-Side Guarantees

The publish service must guarantee:

- immutable artifact objects
- append-only index evolution
- append-only transparency-log evolution
- atomic publication of new metadata snapshots
- no silent overwrite of an existing release body

Public read origins must never accept anonymous direct `PUT` for package publication in the `v2` model.

## 3. Publish Flow

Recommended logical flow:

1. authenticate publisher
2. verify namespace ownership
3. upload and hash source artifact
4. upload and hash optional binary artifacts
5. verify package manifest and dependency policy
6. append release record to the package index
7. update namespace targets metadata
8. update snapshot and timestamp metadata
9. append a transparency-log leaf
10. sign the checkpoint and expose the new static root state

## 4. Release-State Semantics

Required release-state actions:

- `publish`
- `yank`
- `deprecate`
- `undeprecate` by appending a new state record

Rules:

- original artifacts remain immutable
- package history is never silently rewritten
- repeated publish of the same version with a different payload must be rejected

## 5. Namespace Governance

Industrial operation requires explicit namespace governance:

- owner list
- delegation rules
- key rotation policy
- audit trail for state changes

The static read plane only carries the signed outputs of that governance model.

## 6. Security Baseline

A production publish service should provide at least:

- authenticated publishers
- namespace-scoped authorization
- staged uploads
- digest-verified commit
- signing-key isolation from general request handlers
- audit logs for publish/yank/deprecate operations

## 7. Tracked Open-Source Status

The tracked repository now implements:

- `v2` static contract pack
- local role-key generation
- local publish worker for direct source-package commits into a `v2` root
- static-root verification gates

The local worker entrypoint is:

- `scripts/registry-v2-publish.py`

It updates:

- source-artifact storage
- append-only package indexes
- namespace targets metadata
- snapshot and timestamp metadata
- transparency-log checkpoint and leaves

It does not yet ship the hosted publish service itself. That omission is intentional; the repository now freezes the control-plane boundary so backend implementation can proceed independently of clients and mirrors while the public static protocol remains stable.
